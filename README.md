# Title: My Awesome DATA601 Final Project!!

In this project I will implement the thing we learned in DATA601

# Introduction

In this project, we will be working with California Housing data. This data is available free online and it is used because it gives lots of opportunities to understand basics of a DS project. 

Scenario: As we will try to predict a counties median house price, we suppose we are working for CA housing department. As a result of this project we will give them suggested median housing prices based on a counties demographic information.

# Goals

Goals in this project is two folds:

- Train a model with prediction mean squared error is less than $35,000
- Give an confidence interval for each prediction. 

# Motivation & Background

A counties housing price prediction is very useful for determining tax estimates of a house. So public officials needs reliable estimates for that reason. For more details you can check M. Guner's paper on this issue in which they establish a model between the median house price prediction and tax estimate of an house  [Link Description, M,guner et al p.15](link)

# Dataset

This is a dataset obtained from the StatLib repository. Here is the included description:

We collected information on the variables using all the block groups in California from the 1990 Census. In this sample a block group on average includes 1425.5 individuals living in a geographically co mpact area. Naturally, the geographical area included varies inversely with the population density. W e computed distances among the centroids of each block group as measured in latitude and longitude. W e excluded all the block groups reporting zero entries for the independent and dependent variables. T he final data contained 20,640 observations on 9 variables. The dependent variable is ln(median house value).
